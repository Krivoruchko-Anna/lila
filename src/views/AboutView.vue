        Leela, also known as "Leela Chakra" or "The Game of Self-Knowledge," is an ancient Indian board game based on yogic philosophy. It’s designed to symbolize the journey of life, with the goal of achieving self-realization. Originally created by Hindu saints, Leela represents the different stages of spiritual progression, karmic influences, and life experiences. It combines elements of both Snakes and Ladders and a philosophical guide to self-awareness. The game is intended not only to entertain but also to offer insights into one's spiritual and personal growth.

        The aim of Leela is to reach the top square, which represents ultimate self-realization or "Moksha." Players move through different squares representing aspects of life, virtues, vices, chakras, and spiritual experiences. The game teaches about the cycle of rebirth, karmic consequences, and the path toward enlightenment.

    <div class="about__description">
      <p>
        To begin the cycle of spiritual growth, a player must first feel a true, inner desire to embark on the journey—signifying the readiness of consciousness to experience a new beginning—and then roll a six. When a question is asked with sincere intent, a warm sense of confidence often arises in the heart, signaling a blessing from a higher power. This feeling reassures the player, allowing them to roll for a six with trust.

        Rolling a 6 represents the "awakening" needed to gather the momentum for the journey. Only with a 6 can a player move from Square 68 to Square 1, where the journey of progression officially begins. This symbolizes the divine timing required to advance spiritually.

        If a player does not roll a 6, they remain on Square 68, waiting. This waiting period serves as a chance for players to reflect on their intentions for the game and to center their mindset, preparing for the path ahead.

        Each square has a unique significance, marked by symbols or descriptions.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>Ladders:</span> Some squares act as ladders (positive virtues, states of consciousness, etc.), allowing the player to move up to a higher square immediately.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>Snakes:</span> Some squares have snakes (representing vices, negative karma, or challenges), which cause the player to move down to a lower square.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>The objective</span> is to progress by understanding the lesson of each square you land on.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>Understanding Squares:</span>

        Each square represents a symbolic aspect of life or spiritual teaching. When a player lands on a square, they should take a moment to read or interpret the significance of that square, reflecting on its meaning.
        This self-reflection is an essential part of the game, as Leela is intended to be a journey of introspection.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>Reaching Higher Chakras:</span>

        Many Leela boards incorporate the seven chakras, with each chakra associated with particular squares on the board.
        Players experience different stages of self-awareness, moving from lower chakras (root or basic consciousness) to higher chakras (crown, representing enlightenment).
        If a player reaches a square associated with a higher chakra, they are encouraged to pause and reflect on the associated spiritual insights.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>Winning the Game:</span>

        The player who reaches the final square, representing "Moksha" or liberation, wins the game.
        Reaching Moksha signifies transcending the cycle of life and death, representing a metaphorical release from earthly desires and ego.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>Karmic Lessons:</span>

        The game encourages players to reflect on their life journey, virtues, and challenges.
        When landing on certain squares, players may draw cards (if the game includes a deck) or consult the game’s guidebook to understand the karmic or spiritual lesson relevant to that square.
